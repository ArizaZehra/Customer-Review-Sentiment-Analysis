I conducted a Sentiment Analysis on a Kaggle clothing customer review dataset. 
The goal was to assess customer sentiments in their clothing product reviews. After data cleaning and preparation, sentiment analysis techniques were applied to categorize the reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. 
This analysis provides valuable insights for businesses in the fashion industry regarding customer satisfaction and product reception.
