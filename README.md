**Problem Statement:**
The online fashion retailer has accumulated an extensive repository of customer reviews, representing a wide spectrum of sentiments expressed toward our products. Nonetheless, the manual assessment of each review to determine its sentiment proves impractical due to the sheer volume of data.

**Proposed Solution:**
Our solution harnesses the capabilities of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. We have engineered a sentiment analysis model designed to automatically classify customer reviews into distinct sentiment categories, streamlining the process of gauging customer sentiment towards our products. This model not only saves valuable time but also delivers real-time insights, enhancing our business operations.
